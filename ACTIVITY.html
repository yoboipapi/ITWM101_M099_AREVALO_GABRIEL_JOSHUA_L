    <h1>Handlebars</h1>
    <p>By JENNIE (ft. Dua Lipa)</p>

<h5>[Chorus: JENNIE]</h5>

I trip and fall in love<br>
Just like a Tuesday drunk<br>
I always go all in, all in, all in<br>
Over the handlebars<br>
Hitting the ground so hard<br>
If I'm alone, fallin', fallin', fallin'<br>
We ain't gotta talk about it<br>


<h5>[Verse 1: JENNIE, Dua Lipa]</h5>

Mercy<br>
Why is it love is never kind to me? (Me)<br>
I heard that fools rush in and, yeah, that's me (Me)<br>
It burns me time and time again<br>
So why am I still fixing for this frying pan? (Thinkin')<br>


<h5>[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa, JENNIE & Both]</h5>

I wonder what you're doing for tonight and forever (Oh-oh)<br>
I could be the rest of your life or whatever<br>
My lips and your lips, we could press them together (Together, 'gether)<br>
I don't ever think twice, and, baby, that's why<br>


<h5>[Chorus: JENNIE & Dua Lipa]</h5>

I trip and fall in love<br>
Just like a Tuesday drunk<br>
I always go all in, all in, all in<br>
Over the handlebars<br>
Hitting the ground so hard<br>
If I'm alone, fallin', fallin', fallin'<br>

<h5>[Verse 2: Dua Lipa]</h5>

Another round, another drink<br>
I try to stop, but I can't think<br>
About anything else but you (But you)<br>
And I'm a little too buzzed on your love to play it cute<br>
A single kiss, I lost my mind for seven days and seven nights<br>
Can't eat, sleep, baby, it's true (It's true)<br>
Tryna bite my lip, I'm probably gonna slip<br>
And say some crazy shit to you<br>


<h5>[Pre-Chorus: JENNIE & Dua Lipa]</h5>

I wonder what you're doing for tonight and forever (Oh-oh)<br>
I don't ever think twice, and, baby, that's why<br>


<h5>[Chorus: JENNIE & Dua Lipa]</h5>

I trip and fall in love<br>
Just like a Tuesday drunk<br>
I always go all in, all in, all in<br>
Over the handlebars<br>
Hitting the ground so hard<br>
If I'm alone, fallin', fallin', fallin'<br>


<h5>[Outro: Dua Lipa & JENNIE]</h5>

We ain't gotta talk about<br>
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na (Yeah)<br>
We ain't gotta talk about<br>
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na<br>
We ain't gotta talk about it<br>
