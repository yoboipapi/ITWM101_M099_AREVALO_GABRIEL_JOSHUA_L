<h1>HTML</h1>
<p>HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is used to create web pages and web applications. It is a markup language. By HTML we can create our static page. 
    It is used for displaying the data not to transport the data.
    HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. 
    Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. 
    A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. 
    This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly.</p>

    <h1>XML</h1>
    <P>XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a versatile markup language designed for carrying and storing data. It allows users to define their custom tags, making it highly flexible. 
        XML is often used for data interchange between different systems, enabling the sharing of structured information.
        XML is also used to create web pages and web applications. It is dynamic because it is used to transport the data not for displaying the data. The design goals of XML focus on simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet.</P>
